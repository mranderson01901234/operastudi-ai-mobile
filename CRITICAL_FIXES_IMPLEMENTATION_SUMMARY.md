## 🔧 **NEXT STEPS FOR TESTING**

### **Step 1: Apply Database Schema**
```bash
# Run the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard
# Copy contents of fix_database_schema.sql and execute in SQL Editor
```

### **Step 2: Test Authentication Flow**
1. **Sign Up:** Create a new account
2. **Sign In:** Login with existing account
3. **Session Persistence:** Close and reopen app
4. **Sign Out:** Test logout functionality

### **Step 3: Test Complete Workflow**
1. **Upload Image:** Select image from gallery/camera
2. **AI Enhancement:** Run AI enhancement
3. **Save Image:** Save enhanced image to cloud storage
4. **View History:** Check image history screen
5. **New Enhancement:** Start new enhancement cycle

## 🎯 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

### ✅ **Before Fixes (Broken):**
```
944|I/flutter ( 8255): 🧪 Using test mode fallback authentication
996|I/flutter ( 8255): ❌ Error saving image: Exception: User not authenticated
```

### ✅ **After Fixes (Working):**
```
I/flutter: ✅ User authenticated successfully
I/flutter: ✅ Image enhanced successfully
I/flutter: ✅ Image saved to cloud storage
I/flutter: ✅ Processing history updated
```

## �� **CRITICAL NOTES**

1. **Database Schema:** Must be applied to Supabase before testing
2. **Authentication Required:** No more bypass - users must sign up/sign in
3. **Session Persistence:** App will remember logged-in users
4. **Save Functionality:** Now works with proper authentication
5. **Backup Files:** All original files backed up with `.backup` extension
