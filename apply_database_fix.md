# ðŸ”§ Database Fix Instructions

## Problem
The app is failing with:
```
PostgrestException: new row violates row-level security policy for table "users"
```

This happens because the `users` table either:
1. Doesn't exist with the required columns
2. Has incorrect RLS policies

## Solution
Run the database fix script to create/update the schema and policies.

## Instructions

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the contents of `fix_database_rls_issue.sql`
4. Paste into a new query
5. Click **Run** to execute

### Option 2: Supabase CLI (if installed)
```bash
supabase db reset
# Then apply the fix
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f fix_database_rls_issue.sql
```

### Option 3: Direct PostgreSQL Connection
If you have direct access to your PostgreSQL database:
```bash
psql -h your-host -U your-user -d your-database -f fix_database_rls_issue.sql
```

## What the Fix Does

1. **Creates `users` table** with all required columns including `preferences`
2. **Adds missing columns** to existing tables (if they exist)
3. **Sets up proper RLS policies** for authenticated users
4. **Creates `user_images` table** for image metadata
5. **Sets up storage bucket** and policies
6. **Creates performance indexes**
7. **Prepares admin user** (if auth user exists)

## After Running the Fix

1. **Restart your Flutter app** to clear any cached auth state
2. **Try the "Admin Quick Login"** button again
3. **Test image saving** functionality

## Verification

The script includes a verification query at the end that shows the `users` table structure. You should see:
- `preferences` column with `jsonb` type
- All other required columns
- Proper default values

## Expected Behavior After Fix

âœ… Admin Quick Login should work without errors  
âœ… User profile creation should succeed  
âœ… Image saving should work for authenticated users  
âœ… "My Images" section should display saved images  

## If Issues Persist

Check the Flutter logs for any remaining errors and verify:
1. Supabase URL and anon key are correct
2. The database fix was applied successfully
3. RLS policies are enabled and working
