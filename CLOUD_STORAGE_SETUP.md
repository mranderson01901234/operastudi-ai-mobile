# Cloud Storage Setup Instructions

## Database Setup

1. **Run the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard:**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of `database_setup.sql`
   - Execute the script

2. **Verify the setup:**
   - Check that RLS policies are enabled on `users` table
   - Verify `user-images` storage bucket is created
   - Confirm `user_images` table exists with proper policies

## Features Implemented

### ✅ User Profile Creation
